# Respring Status

This is a iOS tweak written in Objective-C & compiled using Theos.

Respring Status is made for jailbroken devices - letting the the user know when the iPhone Springboard (responsible for launching apps, icon management, statusbar control etc) has restarted - AKA "resprung"!

The tweak works by hooking into existing methods & classes within Apple's own iOS framework - in this case the applicationDidFinishLaunching method, contained within the Springboard class.
